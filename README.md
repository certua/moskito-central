# What is Certua MoSKito-Central?

It's a fork from the oroginal Anotheria Moskito Central repository, with fixed applied for the needs of DaaS project:

- Updated Hibernate and related packages to the latest version (With Postgres 9.5+ dialect support)
- Removed the conflicted ASM package 4.1 is not required however was included and was in confilct with the 3.1 implementation (Most probably the main cause of the random issues we experienced)
- Disabled hibernate ddl auto update feature, now we only validate the schema (init schema needs to be already present)
- Fixed the Central logging issue, Central's Logback configuration was in conflict with Tomcat's SLF4J (Removed from the resources)



**MoSKito-Central is the data warehouse for [MoSKito Monitoring system](http://moskito.org).**

It stores the performance data, collected by [MoSKito-Core](https://github.com/anotheria/moskito/tree/master/moskito-core).

## Why do I need it?

By design, MoSKito-Core does not actually store data. It keeps nothing but the values, obtained within the last monitoring interval. 

To store data (in application memory, filesystem or database) for later processing, you will need MoSKito-Central.

## How does it work?

# Why is it good?

**Centralised data warehouse**: stores the entire performance info of your application, as long as you wish.

**Traces data flow between application nodes**, monitoring every system call.

**Data privacy**: keeps collected data locally, with no 3rd party resources involved.

**Multiple data transfer protocols**: RMI and HTTP come 'out-of-the-box', connectors for other protocols are easily configured.

**Flexibility in data storage**: application memory, filesystem (JSON, XML, CSV or any other file format) or database (SQL or non-SQL).

**Embedded or standalone modes**, depending on the size and complexity of your app.
